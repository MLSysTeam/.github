## Hi there 👋

MLSysTeam is an open-source community dedicated to reducing engineering burdens and enabling researchers to focus on model design. To achieve this goal, we have developed a collection of [hands-on tutorials and templates](https://github.com/MLSysTeam/DLTK) that streamline the process of model development and deployment. You can find more information and updates on our [blog](https://yanlu.substack.com/).

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
